## JobSche

A Flask web server for job scheduling. Everything is on the application server and
only the scheduling part would be handled by this web server.

### Job Types
 - RegularJob (Job that would run immediately)
 - DelayedJob (Job that would be executed after a specific time elapses)
 - ScheduledJob (Job that would be executed at a specific time)
 - RecurrentJob (Job that would be executed at a specific interval)

 ### What the application server needs
- Call the scheduling endpoint with (
    job type,
    retries,
    webhook that executes the task that the job requires,
    webhook that would handle the result
)
